It's a cold night in my bed in the heat of the summer
I've been waitin' patiently for a beautiful lover
He's not a cheater, a believer
He's a warm, warm blooded achiever
It's a lonely night in my bed in the heat of the summer, uh
It's so hard when you're with someone
Your heart breaks and it ain't no fun
But I gotta take that risk tonight

Insecure situations
Had me down, so degraded
Felt no pain
Didn't know what I wanted
